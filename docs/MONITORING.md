# Chat Application Monitoring and Rate Limiting

This document outlines the monitoring, error handling, and rate limiting strategies implemented in the Chat Engine application.

## Monitoring Architecture

### 1. Error Logging Service

The `ErrorLoggingService` is the central component for all logging and monitoring activities in the application. It provides:

- Error logging with context and stack traces
- Warning logs for potential issues
- Informational logs for system events
- Log rotation to prevent excessive disk usage
- System information capture for better debugging

### 2. Exception Filters

Two types of exception filters catch and process errors across the application:

- **HTTP Exception Filter**: Handles all REST API errors
- **WebSocket Exception Filter**: Handles all Socket.IO errors

Both filters use the `ErrorLoggingService` to log detailed error information and provide consistent error responses to clients.

### 3. Request Logging

All HTTP requests are logged using the `RequestLoggerMiddleware`, which captures:

- Request method, URL, and client IP
- Request headers (sanitized)
- Request duration
- Response status code
- Error details for failed requests

## Rate Limiting

### Global Rate Limiting

A custom `RateLimiterGuard` extends NestJS's built-in throttling capabilities to:

- Limit requests per client IP address
- Apply different rate limits to different endpoints
- Log rate limit violations
- Support both HTTP and WebSocket connections

### WebSocket-specific Limiting

The `ChatGateway` implements additional rate limiting for WebSocket messages to prevent:
- Message flooding
- Room joining abuse
- Typing notification spam

## Error Handling Strategy

1. **Centralized Logging**: All errors flow through the ErrorLoggingService
2. **Consistent Error Responses**: Standardized error format for all API responses
3. **Global Exception Handling**: Catches unhandled exceptions across the application
4. **Process-level Error Capture**: Handles uncaught exceptions and unhandled rejections
5. **Contextual Information**: Each error log includes request context and system information

## Monitoring Implementation Details

### File Structure

```
src/monitoring/
├── error-logging.service.ts   # Central logging service
├── global-exception.filter.ts # HTTP exception filter
├── ws-exception.filter.ts     # WebSocket exception filter
├── monitoring.module.ts       # Module that exports monitoring components
├── rate-limiter.guard.ts      # Rate limiting implementation
└── request-logger.middleware.ts # HTTP request logging
```

### Integration

The monitoring system is integrated into the application:

1. The `MonitoringModule` is imported in the `AppModule`
2. Exception filters are registered as global providers
3. The rate limiter guard is applied globally
4. The request logger middleware is applied to all routes

## Future Enhancements

1. **External Monitoring Integration**: Add support for services like Sentry, DataDog, or New Relic
2. **Performance Metrics**: Capture and report application performance metrics
3. **Alerting System**: Implement real-time alerts for critical errors
4. **Dashboard**: Create a monitoring dashboard for system health visualization
5. **Distributed Tracing**: Add tracing for requests across microservices
